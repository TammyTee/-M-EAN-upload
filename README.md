# mean-upload
Sample project of a full stack application. 

See working demo here: http://mean-upload.herokuapp.com

### Summary
This project demonstrates my knowledge of creating full stack web applications using current front-end technologies
including AngularJS, NodeJS, and Express.js.

Using this application a user can upload files and see them listed on the front-end. 
_(Note: This application is hosted on a free dyno on Heroku. The files uploaded are kept in temp file system storage 
and does not persist between uses of the application.)_

Unit test using Karma/Jasmine were done to demonstrate my knowledge of writing unit test and testing Javascript code.
